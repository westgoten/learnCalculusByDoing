    <string name="question10_title">A closed cylindrical vessel, in which the height is three times the radius, is increasing
            in size, causing a change in the radius as a function of time according to the expression
            \\(r = \\frac{t^2}{3} + 2t\\), the radius given in centimeters.\n\n When determining the rate of change of the total
            area of the cylinder as a function of time at \\(t = 2s\\), we find the value \\(A\'(2) = \\frac{2560\\pi}{a}\\space cm^2/s\\).
